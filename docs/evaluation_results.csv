Get reacquainted with Bridget Jones in new film â€˜Mad About the Boyâ€™FilmComedy4 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhotograph: Universal Pictures ‘Fourquels’ are usually where film franchises start to flirt with rock bottom, so it’s a joy to report that Mad About the Boy is comfortably the best Bridget Jones outing since Bridget Jones’s Diary. For Renée Zellweger’s still klutzy but now wiser Bridge, living in cosy Hampstead, the singleton Borough era is a distant memory. Ciggies and Chardonnay have been dispensed with replaced with a big dose of lingering grief for lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). It says everything for the script (co-written by Helen Fielding, Dan Mazer and Abi Morgan) that even Daniel Cleaver, now entering his own Jurassic era and a bit sad about it, gets an affecting arc here. The plot will surprise no one, but it barely matters – this is Bridget’s journey of rediscovery.Read review4.

To do this, they keep a diary. Pip’s parents prefer to keep their worries as ungerminated seeds. Twenty years ago, Pip’s father lost his best friend Duncan to AIDS and has tried his best to bury Duncan’s existence. Pip discovers one of Duncan’s old jackets with an old diary stuffed inside the pocket. Almost immediately they feel an affinity with their parents’ old friend. The past starts to overflow like running water. It’s beautiful and touching – a play that shows the wonder of friendship. Read reviewBuy ticketAdvertising5.

Eat semi-pagan British fare at the latest kitchen takeover at The Compton ArmsBritishCanonburyprice 2 of 45 out of 5 starsRecommendedLily Haddadi The latest chefs to take over the kitchen at Islington pub The Compton Arms are Rake; Jay Claus, Syrus Pickhaver and Peter Ward. Their menu is ruddy-faced British gentleman food, rethought for people who don’t own a cottage in the Cotswolds. Here, the spectre of St John is strong, with the likes of salsify and scotch broth, but rather than ostentatious ‘I-dare-you-to-eat-that’ whole beast butchery, Rake’s approach to meat is more earthy and pagan; said duck hearts come in a marvellously dank sauce which soaks into the crunchy toast. It’s a winning dish in a line-up of endless hits. Deep fried cockles on skewers are the perfect pub snack.

Donâ€™t miss The Globeâ€™s first ever Chekhov production â€“ an enjoyably absurdist take on â€˜Three Sistersâ€™DramaSouth BankUntil 19 Apr 20254 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhoto: Johan Persson Adaptor/translator Rory Mullarkey has created a novel take on Chekhov, recasting the titular trio of sisters as less fading, doomed aristocrats waiting to get crushed by the Russian Revolution, and more trapped in an absurdist pantomime. Caroline Steinbeis’s production makes the sisters feel like part of an automata, doomed to repeat their days over and over and over.

See Brie Larson make a UK stage debut in Daniel Fishâ€™s bone-rattling punk rock take on SophoclesDramaCovent GardenUntil 12 Apr 20253 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhoto: Helen Murray Daniel Fish’s take on Sophocles’ Elektra is a curious mixture of chaotic randomness and underlying respect for the 2,500-year-old play. Marvel star Brie Larson puts in a very solid turn as the eponymous princess. We meet Elektra living a twilight existence, locked in a permanent state of impotent rage at her mother Klytannestra (Stockard Channing, acid) and her lover Aegisthus (Greg Hicks, hapless). Famously, they killed her father Agamemnon. Now Elektra wants them dead. Larson’s Elektra stomps about in a Bikini Kill t-shirt with a shaven head, trading sardonic quips with her mother. It’s a gratifyingly bone-ratting 75 minutes of punk rock theatre made with respect for the Ancient Greek tradition. Read reviewBuy ticketAdvertising15.

Say goodbye to Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pembertonâ€™s â€˜Inside No. 9â€™ at their production â€˜Stage/Frightâ€™ComedyCharing Cross RoadUntil 5 Apr 20254 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhoto: Marc Brenner No matter what your thoughts on Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton’s beloved BBC horror anthology series Inside No 9, Stage/Fright is a delight, with the duo at the peak of their powers. It dips into the TV show – the first half heavily revolves around the episode Bernie Clifford’s Dressing Room – but it is a rare spinoff that feels totally a thing of the theatre. That’s partly a result of the pair’s long-standing fascination with Grand Guignol, music hall, stand-up and other forms of stage entertainment. It’s a tribute to theatre and stage life in a broader sense. It’s a parting gift, a celebration of Inside No. 9 and its influences, the real wrap party.Read reviewBuy ticketAdvertising17.

Around 700 years later, the National Gallery is capturing the energy that fuelled the crew, displaying some of their finest and most significant works.Read moreBuy ticket18.\xa0Pick up some bargain pieces for your boring walls at The Other Art FairThings to doMarkets and fairsBrick Lane6 Mar9 Mar 2025Fiona Campbell', ""â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…\xa0'Frameless has managed to create something genuinely exciting' - Time Out\nEscape reality through maximum immersion and experience 42 masterpieces from 29 of the world’s most iconic artists, each reimagined beyond belief, through cutting-edge technology.

That new Brazilian cud is on display here, and it’s gorgeous. The 10 artists in this show mash together indigenous aesthetics, art history and influences from the new European avant garde with a social consciousness and desire to address the challenges of life in Brazil.

Donâ€™t miss this improbably thrilling drama about the 1997 Kyoto climate change summitDramaSohoUntil 3 May 20254 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhoto: Manuel Harlan Kyoto, by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson, is so indecently entertaining it almost feels like the result of a bet to choose the dullest, worthiest subject imaginable and make it as fun as humanly possible. The play is about the Kyoto UN climate change conference of 1997, at which every country on the planet eventually agreed to curb its greenhouse emissions. The secret is that Kyoto is actually a play about a total bastard. Don Pearlman was a real oil lobbyist whose fingerprints were all over climate conferences in the ‘90s. US actor Stephen Kunken is terrific as Pearlman with boundless cynicism and endless lawyer’s tricks. It’s a total thrill ride. Read reviewBuy ticket20. Discover the scientific secrets of Versailles at the Science Museum with 50% offThings to doExhibitionsSouth KensingtonUntil 21 Apr 2025Photo: ChÃ¢teau de Versailles/Christophe Fouin You’ve probably heard all about Versailles’ dazzling Hall of Mirrors and its gorgeous, well-manicured gardens – maybe you’ve even seen them IRL. But do you know about the role the French royal court played in not just spreading scientific knowledge, but making it fashionable, too? The Science Museum’s latest exhibition, ‘Versailles: Science And Splendour’, will uncover that lesser-talked-about side of the palace’s history, diving into the royal family’s relationship with science, women’s impact on medicine, philosophy and botany at the royal court, and showcasing more than 100 items that reinforce those stories – many of which have never been displayed in the UK before.

Celebrate 100 Years of the Charles Dickens MuseumMuseumsBloomsburyUntil 29 Jun 20254 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhotograph: Laura Gallant for Time OutIn 1837, a baby-faced, wavy-haired 25-year-old Charles Dickens moved into 48 Doughty Street. Taking up two small rooms on the first and second floors of the building, the museum’s centenary exhibition illustrates the life and legacy of one of London’s greatest writers via letters, manuscripts, rare first editions, sketches and the cheesy love poems he wrote at 18 (thought to be his earliest surviving writing). If The Muppets Christmas Carol is as far as your Dickens knowledge stretches, this is an accessible showcase. You’ll leave feeling endeared to Dickens and charmed by the fervent admiration the museum evidently has for its subject.Read review22.

It can only mean one thing; March is right around the corner. This means it’s time to finally come out of winter hibernation and set about exploring the city’s fantastic parks and gardens, world-class museums and galleries, and unbeatable restaurant and bar offerings. From St Paddy’s to Mothering Sunday, Pancake Day to International Women’s Day, the third month of the year packs in a whole host of big celebrations. And it’s also an especially great month for culture vultures. There are a host of film festivals happening around the city, from BFI Flare and the inaugural London Soundtrack Festival to Kinoteka, Cinema Made in Italy and the Banff Mountain Film Festival. And there’s also Deptford Literature Festival, the Young Barbican Takeover Festival, music conference series AVA London and the Other Art Fair.

It concerns Jacob Dunne, a young man from Nottingham who got into a senseless confrontation with trainee paramedic James Hodgkinson and unwittingly killed him with a single punch. He was subsequently forgiven by te victim’s parents, who made an effort to help him turn his life around. Technically an addition to Kwame Kwei-Armah’s tenure at the Young Vic rather than the debut of the new regime, the Adam Penford-directed production transfers to London with its original lead cast of Julie Hesmondhalgh, Tony Hirst and David Shields returning.Read moreBuy ticket2.

The coldest and wettest of school holidays, it’s not that promising on paper, but London always rises to the challenge magnificently – of all the half-terms, this is the one that boasts the large number of things for kids to do indoors, with the mighty Imagine Festival at the Southbank Centre probably the biggest annual event in the London kids’ calendar, and plenty more on besides, from a Robot Zoo at the Horniman to the new Ancient Egypt exhibition at the Young V&A. Here are my top suggestions for the half-term.Read more2. Remember the issues pulsing through 1990s Britain at this exhibition of Donald Rodneyâ€™s artArtWhitechapelUntil 4 May 2025Donald Rodney, In the House of My Father, 1997, Image Â© The Donald Rodney Estate In his far too short career, Donald Rodney (1961-1998) created an incredibly varied body of work, using a huge breadth of mediums to confront the prejudices that course through British society. The works here tackle themes of racial identity, chronic illness and colonial history, and are a fascinating window into the issues that mattered in 1990s Britain, and still resonate today.Read moreAdvertising3. Get reacquainted with Bridget Jones in new film â€˜Mad About the Boyâ€™FilmComedy4 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhotograph: Universal Pictures ‘Fourquels’ are usually where film franchises start to flirt with rock bottom, so it’s a joy to report that Mad About the Boy is comfortably the best Bridget Jones outing since Bridget Jones’s Diary. For Renée Zellweger’s still klutzy but now wiser Bridge, living in cosy Hampstead, the singleton Borough era is a distant memory. Ciggies and Chardonnay have been dispensed with replaced with a big dose of lingering grief for lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). It says everything for the script (co-written by Helen Fielding, Dan Mazer and Abi Morgan) that even Daniel Cleaver, now entering his own Jurassic era and a bit sad about it, gets an affecting arc here. The plot will surprise no one, but it barely matters – this is Bridget’s journey of rediscovery.Read review4. Watch Coral Wylieâ€™s excellent debut about a lonely teenager taking refuge in his parentâ€™s pastDramaShepherdâ€™s BushUntil 22 Mar 20254 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhoto: Helen Murray In Coral Wylie’s nature-driven debut Pip – also played by Wylie – is a non-binary 19-year-old trying to make sense of themselves and their world. To do this, they keep a diary. Pip’s parents prefer to keep their worries as ungerminated seeds. Twenty years ago, Pip’s father lost his best friend Duncan to AIDS and has tried his best to bury Duncan’s existence. Pip discovers one of Duncan’s old jackets with an old diary stuffed inside the pocket. Almost immediately they feel an affinity with their parents’ old friend. The past starts to overflow like running water. It’s beautiful and touching – a play that shows the wonder of friendship. Read reviewBuy ticketAdvertising5.

Immerse yourself in NYCâ€™s 70â€™s downtown scene at this Peter Hujar retrospectiveArtSpitalfieldsUntil 6 Apr 20255 out of 5 starsRecommendedPhotograph: Stephen Varble (III), Soho, New York, 1976 Â© 2025 the Peter Hujar Archive / Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY, DACS London, Pace Gallery, NY, Fraenkel Gallery, SF, Maureen Paley, London, and Mai 36 Galerie, Zurich By rights, Peter Hujar should be far more famous than he is. A contemporary of Robert Mapplethorpe and Nan Goldin, and a close friend of Paul Thek and David Wojnarowicz, he rubbed shoulders with countless artists and literary luminaries, photographing everyone from Andy Warhol, Susan Sontag and Wiliam S. Burroughs to Greer Langton, John Waters and Cookie Mueller. Many of these photographs are on display in this landmark exhibition, amongst a huge variety of tender, poised, enigmatic, compassionate photographs that cement Hujar’s reputation as a major force in 20th-century photography.Read review8. Eat semi-pagan British fare at the latest kitchen takeover at The Compton ArmsBritishCanonburyprice 2 of 45 out of 5 starsRecommendedLily Haddadi The latest chefs to take over the kitchen at Islington pub The Compton Arms are Rake; Jay Claus, Syrus Pickhaver and Peter Ward. Their menu is ruddy-faced British gentleman food, rethought for people who don’t own a cottage in the Cotswolds. Here, the spectre of St John is strong, with the likes of salsify and scotch broth, but rather than ostentatious ‘I-dare-you-to-eat-that’ whole beast butchery, Rake’s approach to meat is more earthy and pagan; said duck hearts come in a marvellously dank sauce which soaks into the crunchy toast. It’s a winning dish in a line-up of endless hits. Deep fried cockles on skewers are the perfect pub snack. Browned oysters rarebit are cooked with a creamy, addictively mustardy gunk and ray wing']","This weekend in London, you can enjoy a variety of events and activities.

It can only mean one thing; March is right around the corner. This means it’s time to finally come out of winter hibernation and set about exploring the city’s fantastic parks and gardens, world-class museums and galleries, and unbeatable restaurant and bar offerings. From St Paddy’s to Mothering Sunday, Pancake Day to International Women’s Day, the third month of the year packs in a whole host of big celebrations. And it’s also an especially great month for culture vultures. There are a host of film festivals happening around the city, from BFI Flare and the inaugural London Soundtrack Festival to Kinoteka, Cinema Made in Italy and the Banff Mountain Film Festival. And there’s also Deptford Literature Festival, the Young Barbican Takeover Festival, music conference series AVA London and the Other Art Fair.

Catch the West End transfer of James Grahamâ€™s acclaimed restorative justice drama â€˜Punchâ€™DramaWaterloo1 Mar12 Apr 2025Photo: Marc BrennerSurely the most successful British playwright of our time, unstoppable hit machine James Graham scored a hit in his near hometown of Nottingham early in 2024 with ‘Punch’, a shocking true tale of violence and redemption. It concerns Jacob Dunne, a young man from Nottingham who got into a senseless confrontation with trainee paramedic James Hodgkinson and unwittingly killed him with a single punch. He was subsequently forgiven by te victim’s parents, who made an effort to help him turn his life around. Technically an addition to Kwame Kwei-Armah’s tenure at the Young Vic rather than the debut of the new regime, the Adam Penford-directed production transfers to London with its original lead cast of Julie Hesmondhalgh, Tony Hirst and David Shields returning.Read moreBuy ticket2. Get the Guinnesses in for St Patrickâ€™s Day in LondonThings to doPhotograph: Sandor Szmutko The Irish really know how to celebrate, so when it comes to St Patrick’s Day in London, the city’s Irish community has no problem showing us how it’s done.
