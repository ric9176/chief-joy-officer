## Problem Statement

### The Challenge

In group chats, organizing social events can be challenging as no one has the time to research activities, check schedules, and make bookings. Typically, one person takes on the responsibility of planning, which can be a burden.

### The User Perspective

- Social connection is vital, but busy schedules make it difficult to plan engaging activities.
- Some groups have a "social architect," but if they get too busy, the quality of social time diminishes.
- Our target users are individuals aged 25-40 who are busy with work but value quality time with friends.

## Proposed Solution

CJO is an AI assistant that acts as a group chat participant, proactively suggesting events and activities. It:

- Learns group preferences through chat interactions.
- Provides personalized recommendations.
- Assists with booking and event details.
- Enables effortless planning and decision-making within the group chat.

| **Evaluations**         | Langsmith, Ragas                                      |

## Agentic Reasoning

CJO will use agentic reasoning to:

- Enhance contextual understanding using Qdrantâ€™s vector store.
- Retrieve live event data via Tavily.
- Implement long-term memory for personalized recommendations.

## Data Sources & APIs

| Source                                             | Purpose                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| [Time Out London](https://www.timeout.com/london/) | Provides event data for POC                  |
| Tavily                                             | Web search for additional context            |
| Firecrawl                                          | Scraping multiple sources (future expansion) |
| Long-term Memory Storage                           | Tracks user preferences over time            |

## Chunking Strategy

Using **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** (Langchain) for structured text splitting:

- Keeps paragraphs intact for better semantic coherence.
- Adapts dynamically to text structure for optimized retrieval.

## Prototype Development

CJO was built by refactoring an existing Chainlit app **pythonic-rag** to integrate Langgraph and a ReAct pattern for **Agentic RAG + web search**.

## Performance Evaluation

### Initial RAG Evaluation Metrics

| Metric                | Score |
| --------------------- | ----- |
| Context Recall        | 0.620 |
| Faithfulness          | 0.885 |
| Factual Correctness   | 0.310 |
| Answer Relevancy      | 0.762 |
| Context Entity Recall | 0.393 |
| Noise Sensitivity     | 0.300 |

#### Key Takeaways

- **Good**: Faithfulness and answer relevancy.
- **Needs Improvement**: Factual correctness, entity recall, and context recall.
- **Action Items**:
  - Increase retrieval context (adjust `k` value).
  - Optimize chunking strategy.
  - Fine-tune the embedding model.
